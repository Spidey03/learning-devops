#### Regions
AWS has the concept of a **Region**, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone. <br />
Each AWS Region consists of _multiple, isolated, and physically separate **AZ**s_ within a geographic area.
