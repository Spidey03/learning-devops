### Regions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AWS has the concept of a **Region**, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone. <br />
Each AWS Region consists of _multiple, isolated, and physically separate **AZ**s_ within a geographic area.

### Availability Zones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within each region, there are multiple isolated locations known as **Availability Zones**. Each availability zone is one or more data-centers with redundant network and connectivity and power supply. Multiple availability zones ensure high availability in case one of them goes down.
